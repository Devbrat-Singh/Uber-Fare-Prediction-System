📌 Project OverviewThis project implements a Machine Learning pipeline to predict the fare amount for Uber rides based on travel distance, passenger count, and temporal features. Using a dataset of approximately 200,000 records, the system analyzes ride patterns to estimate costs accurately.
⚙️ Workflow & MethodologyData Cleaning: Handled missing values and removed invalid GPS coordinates (e.g., latitudes outside -90 to 90).Feature Engineering:Calculated Geodesic Distance between pickup and drop-off points using geopy.Extracted temporal features (Hour, Weekday, Month, Year) from timestamps.Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables.Outlier Removal: Utilized the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to filter out extreme outliers in fare amounts and distances.Data Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize numerical features for better model convergence.
🤖 Models & PerformanceThree regression models were trained and evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using RandomizedSearchCV.Linear Regression: $R^2$ Score: ~0.71 (Baseline)Random Forest Regressor: $R^2$ Score: ~0.74XGBoost Regressor: $R^2$ Score: ~0.79 (Best Model)The XGBoost model provided the highest accuracy and was selected as the final estimator. The trained model has been serialized as model.pkl for future inference.
